My understanding of object-oriented programming improved by helping 
me understand better why it is useful. One thing I liked about it is
that it helps organize the code together by grouping functions. I also 
became better in deciding what should be used as instance variables. 
Working with ArrayLists helped me become more familar with its methods 
such as size() and get(). 

A challenge that I faced was that I forgot how to read file in Java. I 
consulted the W3Schools website to read on how to do it. After reading, I 
realized I need to import some classes which I was able to use to read 
the file. Another issue I encountered was that I created a few functions at
at time without testing them. When I ran them, I got a lot of errors at once. 
However, this was easy to fix because I got useful error messages and the lines
the errors appeared at were correct. For this, it was useful to fix the bugs
one by one to make sure that I didn't cause any new errors.
